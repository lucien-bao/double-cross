                <p>
                    Penguins are flightless seabirds known for their distinctive black-and-white coloring and upright
                    waddle. Penguins are expert swimmers, using their wings like flippers to navigate through oceans in
                    search of fish, krill, and other marine life. They thrive in some of the world's harshest
                    environments, but those environments are now under threat.

                <p>
                    Penguins face numerous threats to their survival, with climate change, overfishing, and habitat
                    destruction among the most significant challenges. Melting sea ice in Antarctica reduces hunting
                    grounds for penguins that rely on fish and krill, while warming ocean temperatures disrupt their
                    food sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, oil spills and plastic pollution pose ongoing risks to their habitats. Conservation
                    efforts focus on protecting marine reserves, regulating fishing practices, and reducing carbon
                    emissions to preserve the delicate ecosystems penguins depend on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Penguin Company advocates for marine protected areas, raises awareness about the impacts of
                    \climate change, and promotes responsible tourism that doesn't harm penguin colonies. Our ongoing
                    research also plays a vital role in understanding how penguins adapt to environmental changes, which
                    is essential for creating effective long-term conservation strategies.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Penguin fun facts</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Penguins are incredibly agile in water, reaching speeds of up to 15 miles per hour when swimming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Penguins' black-and-white plumage serves as camouflage while they hunt. The dark back blends
                        with the ocean depths when viewed from above, and their white belly matches the bright surface
                        when seen from below.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Emperor penguins can dive deeper than any other bird, reaching depths of over 1,800 feet (550
                        meters) in search of food, and can stay submerged for up to 20 minutes!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each penguin has a unique call, allowing them to identify their mates and chicks in noisy
                        colonies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some penguins live in warm climates. While we often associate penguins with icy environments,
                        species like the African penguin and Gal√°pagos penguin live in much warmer areas.
                    </li>
