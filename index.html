                This is my apartment's living room (before we moved in).
                It's my favorite place because it's where my friends and
                I hang out together.

            My favorite restaurant is Five Guys. Here is
            <a href="https://restaurants.fiveguys.com/65-station-landing"
            target="_blank">the Five Guys location closest to Tufts</a>.

            Something no one would expect about me is that, despite having
            lived near the coast my whole life, I hate (almost all) seafood.
